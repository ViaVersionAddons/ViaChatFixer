ViaChatFixer is a Bukkit and Sponge plugin that allows 1.11+ players to have longer chat messages on 1.8-1.10 servers with ViaVersion

In Minecraft 1.11, the maximum messages length has gone from 100 characters to 256 characters. So if your server is under 1.11, 1.11 and higher
players will have their chat messages cut at 100 characters.

This plugin fix this problem, so 1.11 and higher players will be able to send longer chat messages up to 256 characters.

## Downloads

You can download releases and find more information on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viachatfixer.61955/).

## Installation

Just put the ViaChatFixer jar in your plugins folder.

ViaChatFixer currently supports ViaVersion v5.0 or higher, and requires Java 17.

All players online during a reload will not be able to have longer chat messages until they reconnect.

## Supported Platforms

ViaChatFixer can be installed on Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers or on Sponge servers.

If you are using a proxy, ViaVersion and ViaChatFixer must be installed on the backend servers.
